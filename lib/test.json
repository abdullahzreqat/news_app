In the recent past, the spotlight was focused on admissions to public schools across Gauteng. This was also because some parents were shuttling around seeking space for their children, including those who applied late. The right to education is dependent on having access to a school or a learning facility. For this reason, the administration of admissions to schools is a key tool as it is based on feeder zones and the right to access a school in the vicinity of the child's home and applies only to Grade 1 and Grade 8 learners. While most learners were successfully placed on time, problems that were faced by some parents, while legitimate, do not warrant the scrapping of the online admission system. The department spared no efforts to support parents and ensure children are placed in schools. All pupils, including late applicants have been placed in Grade 1 and 8. However, the department is struggling to place learners in the other grades. This currently remains a school-based application and placement process. Distorted picture However, the commentary, especially from the mainstream media, portrayed a distorted picture of the challenges of providing learning and teaching spaces. Specifically, it was argued that bureaucratic bundling and inefficiency were the main factors behind learners being placed in schools. From this flows the recommendation to scrap the online admission system for grades 1 and 8 because it is claimed that it frustrates parents. If only matters were that simple. Of course, there are areas that require attention, such as proper communication with parents when they seek clarity on the status of application. The demand for schooling is a function of several factors. These include the availability of spaces/classrooms; language; demographic changes; learner performance, and socio-economic factors. Improving administrative efficiency will improve citizen satisfaction but on its own will not remove these binding constraints. This is not an excuse, but a hard reality facing the department. On the demographic front, Gauteng has surpassed KwaZulu-Natal as the biggest concentration of the South African population. The demographic shift pronounced itself in various ways. The Gauteng education system grows annually by 2.5%, or a net increase of 65 000 learners per annum. To this must be added inward migration from other provinces and countries into Gauteng. READ | Five years after its launch, Gauteng's online school application system still has issues The black majority has moved into former white, coloured, and Indian communities, yet the schools in these areas were not designed to accommodate large number of learners. Gauteng is also a cosmopolitan place and communities are multilingual, and schools must cater for different language options. Single-medium schools spawned by apartheid planning in townships and suburbs are not viable in the long run as this will run out of an adequate number of learners to constitute a school. Still, 75% of African learners remain in township schools and schools in former Indian and coloured areas have 50% African learners. The combined effect of the demographic change is an overwhelming demand for learning spaces or classrooms in a supply-constrained situation. More schools and classrooms are required to deal with historical backlog and meet new demand in the province. One estimate predicts that over 100 new schools are required in the province to address the current demand. On this front, the department is chasing a moving target. It is the lack of schools and classrooms which are the ultimate obstacle to placing learners rather than the online system. New capacity needed Several interventions are being implemented to increase the number of classrooms, but unless new capacity is added, admission to Gauteng schools will remain an annual challenge. In the interim, money has been transferred to schools, especially in historical townships and suburbs to build additional classrooms. In addition, mobile classrooms are being manufactured and deployed to schools, unfortunately at a slower pace than anticipated. It is now accepted that the economic situation in the country is tight. This has seen many parents taking their children out of independent/private schools to public schools. Parents that can no longer afford fees at independent or private schools have submitted applications for in-between grades to many public schools. It is still hard to find spaces for these learners in schools. Admissions to schools is a delicate balance between parental choice, based on feeder zones, and the availability of schools or classrooms. Many schools in Gauteng reach capacity within the first day of placement. To illustrate the point, say a school can accept 200 learners, but 1 000 parents apply to the school, the surplus of 800 learners should be accommodated elsewhere. Placement of the 200 also depends on whether all learners in the school are promoted to the next grade. Under these circumstances, it is not possible to accommodate all learners in this school, and the department is obliged to find and offer an alternative. Some parents accept the alternative, while some reject these options for a variety of reasons. A parent can object or lodge an appeal, and these succeed only if the school or officials did not follow the admission prescript. However, the department would have fulfilled its obligation to offer placement, but if this is rejected, it is now incumbent on the parent to find a suitable school. We have also observed some negative practices where parents buy or obtain addresses close to the school of choice while not residing in the feeder zone. Thus, admission into public schools, especially, for the highly demanded grades 1 and 8, is a function of many factors. The silent majority can attest to the efficacy of the online system in processing applications and placing learners in schools. This is not to dismiss the legitimate concerns of parents seeking placement but to provide more information on the real binding constraints affecting admissions to schools. It is also not an excuse for the department to do nothing. In fact, the department is exploring different methods to accelerate the building of new schools and to add more learning spaces. Unfortunately, the infrastructure budget is insufficient due to economic constraints but soldier on, we will. - Matome Chiloane is the MEC for Education in Gauteng. *Want to respond to the columnist?

With 50% of Nepal's imports coming from India, Nepal's food consumption is greatly getting influenced by food manufacturing and retail practices in India that are currently driven by the high-value processing of various agricultural products, increased urbanization, rising disposable incomes, and the demand for convenient food. As Nepal's economy develops, its food choices are likely to evolve in the same manner while demand for preventive healthcare will become the preferred norm as opposed to curative healthcare. What this means is that the food manufacturing and retail sector stands at the convergence of our nutritional goals. From labelling innovations to communicating nutritional values, there is a large role for the private sector to play as affordability and accessibility become crucial determinants of food choice and access, driving dietary patterns, nutrition status and overall health and environmental outcomes. While agriculture constitutes over 25% of the Nepali economy, nearly 24% of agricultural crops consist of paddy production, Nepal is thus a country of rice eaters, with carbohydrate-heavy diets. Secondly, a lack of awareness regarding balanced food and the importance of protein results in low consumption of protein in Nepal. And this underlying 'protein paradox' i.e., high importance vis-à-vis low understanding could be where manufacturers and retailers can step up in making Nepal consume adequate protein. Along with supporting measures for improving back-of-Department of Food Technology and Quality Control (DFTQC) package (BOP) nutrient information to labels complying with Codex standards, the internationally accepted code in the food business, the industry needs to innovate or proactively support and voluntarily adopt means to communicate nutrition to help influence food choices. For instance, the voluntary Soy Fed Product label has been launched in Nepal in 2022 as a unique feed label for high-quality animal protein products. Issuing press releases, briefings, and commentaries Disseminating reports, studies, and publications Making written or oral submissions to parliamentary committees and inquiries Working with the media Holding public meetings and events Convening conferences and workshops Creating and contributing to educational materials Disseminating nutritional communication through a range of different means or tools such as radio, television, video, film, internet, social media, newspapers, newsletters, leaflets, poster campaigns and the arts. Also, including visual tools such as stickers, logos, t-shirts, and banners The Poultry industry can take adopt the unique Soy Fed Product Label and use the opportunities to talk about how their animal feed consists of high-quality protein As we all know nutritional access is only part of the overall nutrition story. To ensure improved nutritional outcomes, consumer awareness about the adverse health impacts of imbalanced nutritional practices is critical. A low proportion of protein-rich foods such as soy, milk, meat, eggs, and legumes in the daily diet has resulted in malnutrition of millions of Nepalese including the problem of stunting in nearly 40% of kids below 5 years of age. Therefore, the industry has a major role to play in communicating nutrition recommendations to the consumer. Improved awareness can help in several ways, including – addressing regional pockets with high micronutrient deficiencies, enabling consumer avoidance of identified quality and safety issues with foods, enabling better decision-making in food choices for daily energy, protein, and fat intake, and driving market demand for new products, which enables wider choices, better quality products, and creation of new food segments. Nepal's food manufacturers and retailers also need to balance consumer demand for affordable and convenient food with the need to promote healthier dietary choices. This requires a delicate balancing act, as many consumers may not be willing or able to pay a premium for healthier options, especially in a country where food insecurity is a significant challenge. At the same time, however, there is growing recognition that a lack of access to adequate protein is a major contributor to malnutrition and poor health outcomes. Ultimately, the success of Nepal's food industry will depend on its ability to adapt to changing consumer needs and preferences while also promoting better health outcomes for all. By working together to raise awareness about the importance of protein and to develop new products and marketing strategies that meet the needs of consumers, food manufacturers and retailers can help to build a more sustainable and resilient food system for Nepal's future. In other words, the next frontier for Nepali food manufacturers, retailers and importers is to ensure availability of healthy, nutritious foods, revolutionizing the way food is presented and aiding the purchase journey of consumers. As the President of the Nepal Feed Industries Association and a staunch supporter of the Right to Protein initiative, I urge the industry to join forces and work together towards this common goal of nutritional awareness for nutrition security, starting with the most crucial macronutrient – 'Protein'. From enhancing protein communication on products to dedicated efforts on #ProteinDay to support public awareness initiatives, the food industry has a larger, proactive role to play in enabling our country to fight disguised nutrition poverty and making it nutrition secure.

Toll gate guards play a crucial role in maintaining safety and order at toll gates. They are responsible for collecting toll fees, ensuring that vehicles adhere to safety regulations, and preventing unauthorized access to the toll gate. These guards work in shifts, typically for 8-12 hours a day, and are required to be alert and attentive at all times. One of the primary duties of a toll gate guard is to collect toll fees from vehicles passing through the toll gate. The Facebook page “Philippines CCTV & DASH CAM Spotted” posted video of a guard throwing a traffic cone at an oncoming rider who refused to stop during apprehension. The video elicits comments from the online community. In the video, a motorbike rider is on his way to a toll gate when he is stopped by a member of the staff. The motorists, however, refused to stop and skirted the crew. Unfortunately, the guard blocked his passage with a traffic cone, resulting in an accident. The motorbike rider was thrown to the ground and his bike was damaged as a result of the incident. The footage, according to netizens, was taken in China, not in the Philippines. But, as of this writing, the location of the incident has not been confirmed. The video has a caption: “ Yun pala ang gamit sa traffic cone.” The social media users expressed their reactions to the post: What can you say about this incident ?

Even from the time he had his first TV appearance through the Kapamilya reality show Pinoy Big Brother , viewers already knew that Jayson is a comic. Following that stint, he indeed had several projects showcasing how funny he is. However, despite his ability to make other people laugh, Jayson went through a phase in which he cried a lot. In a recent interview, based on the article in Abante, the comedian’s mental health was challenged. “ Kapag gabi, takot na takot ako, kasi alam kong maggagabi, sabi ko, ‘hindi na naman ako makakatulog kasi ang dami kong iniisip’. Minsan alas-sais na, dinadaya ko na ang sarili ko kasi nga gigising na ‘yung asawa ko, maghahatid ng anak. Kunwari tulog ako, pero ang tulog ko pa lang alas-otso ng umaga, ‘yung talagang pagod na pagod na ang utak ko kaiisip, ” Jayson Gainza shared. At that time, he kept on thinking about what could be his next project or if he is still relevant. The comedian added that he was thinking ahead of what he is supposed to think and so it led to d=pression. There were also times when he doubted himself that he is not good enough and he can’t do certain things. It also reached to the point when he did not want to talk to his family. “ Noong mga time na sa kuwarto na ako kumakain, sabi ko ‘Ma, iakyat mo na lang ako ng pagkain sa itaas. Ayaw ko talaga. Kahit ‘yung anak ko, hindi ko nakakausap ‘yung anak ko, gusto ko nasa kuwarto lang, ayaw kong lumabas ,” he said. While working at that time, his co-stars would talk to him but what they were saying would just pass him. One time, he called his wife while he was driving. Jayson shared that he was crying at that time. “ Sabi ko ‘Mahal hindi ko alam kung ano ang nangyayari.’ Sabi niya ‘Hala, anong nangyayari sa ‘yo? Itigil mo ang sasakyan!’ Parang takot akong mag-drive, ” the comedian shared. Eventually, Jayson Gainza consulted a psychiatrist and he was advised to continue his therapy. He was also told that he should have someone who he can talk to always. What can you say about this?

The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because Machado must pass a physical before the deal, which was first reported by , is finalized. “We're excited to be here for the rest of our careers and have this hat go into the ,” Machado said as he passed a group of reporters before batting second against the and going 2 for 3. Machado, 30, had said that after this season he planned to opt out of the $300 million, 10-year free agent deal he signed in 2019. With the $120 million he already has received, the new deal increases the free-spending Padres' commitment to Machado to $470 million over 15 years. Machado, who has helped turn the Padres into a World Series contender, finished second in the NL MVP race last year. He'll anchor a superstar-laden lineup that includes Xander Bogaerts, Juan Soto and Fernando Tatis Jr., who can return on April 20 from an 80-game suspension for performance-enhancing drugs. Earlier in spring training, Machado said a deadline for negotiating a new deal had passed, but owner Peter Seidler has said that retaining the smooth-fielding third baseman was his top priority. Seidler, a member of the O'Malley family that once owned the Dodgers, hasn't been afraid to spend big money in pursuit of the franchise's first World Series title. The Padres haven't been to the Fall Classic since 1998, when they were swept by the New York Yankees. Hometown product Joe Musgrove was given a $100 million, five-year deal in July. The Padres signed Bogaerts to a $280 million, 11-year contract just after the winter meetings and signed ace Yu Darvish to a new $108 million, six-year deal earlier this month. With the flashy Tatis sidelined all of last year, first due to injury and then the suspension, Machado was a steadying force in helping lead the Padres on a thrilling run to the NL Championship Series, where they lost in five games to the . The Padres eliminated the 101-win New York Mets in the wild-card round and then beat the 111-win rival Dodgers in the NL Division Series. Machado and Bogaerts are under contract through 2033, while Tatis is locked up through 2034 under a $340 million, 14-year deal he signed in early 2021. Soto is under contract for two more seasons. Machado batted .298 with 32 home runs and 102 RBIs in 2022 and is entering his 12th big league season. He has a career .282 batting average with an .833 OPS, 283 homers and 853 RBIs. He has also been remarkably durable, playing in all 162 games twice and in fewer than 150 games just once, excluding the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. He was limited to 82 games in 2014, when he didn't make his season debut until May 1 due to knee surgery the previous year, and then had the season cut short by a knee injury in August. Machado played in 150 games last year. He sustained a scary-looking sprained left ankle on June 19 at Colorado but returned less than two weeks later. The $350 million deal would be baseball's fourth-largest contract behind Mike Trout ($426.5 million for 12 years), Mookie Betts ($365 million for 12 years) and Aaron Judge ($360 million for nine years). However, the $31.8 million average will rank just 16th. ___ Baseball Writer Ronald Blum in New York contributed to this report. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports","pubDate":"2023-02-27 03:56:47","image_url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/02/27/04/Padres_Machado_Contract_Baseball_72321.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp","source_id":"independentangola","category":["top"],"country":["angola"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Musk says media racist to whites, Asians amid ‘Dilbert’ backlash","link":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/2/27/musk-says-media-racist-to-whites-asians-after-dilbert-backlash","keywords":["News"],"creator":null,"video_url":null,"description":"Billionaire's claim comes amid backlash against “Dilbert” creator Scott Adams over comments about Black people.","content":"Elon Musk has accused the media of being racist against white and Asian people amid a backlash against a popular cartoon strip author who made discriminatory remarks about Black people.

Musk later tweeted his agreement with another user who said Adams’s comments “weren’t good” but US society had leaned into identity with “predictable results” and should return to colour-blindness around race. Musk’s views on free speech, race and other contentious issues have been in the spotlight since . Under Musk’s leadership, Twitter has relaxed moderation rules regarding hate speech and reinstated the accounts of far-right and other controversial figures, including neo-Nazis. Musk, who has described himself as a free-speech absolutist, has pledged to encourage viewpoint diversity on Twitter and address the liberal bias he claims held sway under the platform’s previous management. In an appearance on his YouTube show last week, Adams said that white Americans should “get the hell away from Black people” and it “makes no sense whatsoever as a white citizen of America to try to help Black citizens anymore”. Adams, whose comic strip is widely syndicated in newspapers worldwide, also said he had moved to a primarily white neighbourhood to “escape”. Adams made the remarks in response to a Rasmussen poll carried out earlier this month that found 26 percent of Black Americans did not agree with the statement “It’s OK to be white,” while 21 percent were “not sure”. Overall, 72 percent of respondents, including 53 percent of Black people, agreed it was “OK to be white”, with just 12 percent of the general population disagreeing with the statement, according to Rasmussen. The Washington Post, USA Today, the Los Angeles Times and other US newspapers have dropped “Dilbert” in recent days in response to Adams’s comments.","pubDate":"2023-02-27 03:54:35","image_url":null,"source_id":"aljazeeraall","category":["top"],"country":["angola"],"language":"english"}],"nextPage":"16774700757c709195888df7eab0bb44a380788f6a"}

"،" content ":" يعتبر الافتقار إلى المدارس والفصول الدراسية هو العقبة النهائية أمام وضع المتعلمين ، بدلاً من نظام الإنترنت ، كما كتب Gauteng Education MEC Matome Chiloane. في الماضي القريب ، تم التركيز على القبول في المدارس العامة عبر غوتنغ. ويرجع ذلك أيضًا إلى أن بعض الآباء كانوا يتنقلون في أرجاء المكان بحثًا عن مكان لأطفالهم ، بما في ذلك أولئك الذين تقدموا في وقت متأخر. ويعتمد الحق في التعليم على وجود الوصول إلى مدرسة أو مرفق تعليمي. لهذا السبب ، تعد إدارة عمليات القبول في المدارس أداة رئيسية لأنها تستند إلى مناطق التغذية والحق في الوصول إلى مدرسة قريبة من منزل الطفل ولا تنطبق إلا على طلاب الصف الأول والصف الثامن. في حين تم وضع معظم المتعلمين بنجاح في الوقت المحدد ، إلا أن المشكلات التي واجهها بعض الآباء ، على الرغم من كونها مشروعة ، لا تستدعي إلغاء نظام القبول عبر الإنترنت. لم تدخر الوزارة أي جهد لدعم أولياء الأمور وضمان إلحاق الأطفال بالمدارس. تم وضع جميع الطلاب ، بمن فيهم المتقدمون المتأخرون ، في الصف الأول والثامن. ومع ذلك ، فإن القسم يكافح من أجل وضع المتعلمين في الصفوف الأخرى. لا يزال هذا حاليًا عبارة عن عملية تقديم وتنسيب في المدرسة. صورة مشوهة ومع ذلك ، فإن التعليق ، وخاصة من وسائل الإعلام الرئيسية ، يصور صورة مشوهة لتحديات توفير مساحات التعلم والتعليم. على وجه التحديد ، قيل أن التجميع البيروقراطي وعدم الكفاءة هما العاملان الرئيسيان وراء وضع المتعلمين في المدارس. من هذا المنطلق ، تنبع التوصية بإلغاء نظام القبول عبر الإنترنت للصفين الأول والثامن لأنه يُزعم أنه يحبط الآباء. لو كانت الأمور بهذه البساطة. بالطبع ، هناك مجالات تتطلب الاهتمام ، مثل التواصل المناسب مع أولياء الأمور عند سعيهم لتوضيح حالة الطلب. الطلب على التعليم هو دالة لعدة عوامل. وتشمل هذه توافر المساحات / الفصول الدراسية ؛ لغة؛ التغيرات الديموغرافية؛ أداء المتعلم ، والعوامل الاجتماعية والاقتصادية. سيؤدي تحسين الكفاءة الإدارية إلى تحسين رضا المواطنين ولكنه لن يزيل بمفرده هذه القيود الملزمة. هذا ليس عذرا ، لكنه واقع صعب يواجه الدائرة. على الجبهة الديموغرافية ، تجاوز Gauteng كوازولو ناتال باعتباره أكبر تجمع لسكان جنوب إفريقيا. برز التحول الديموغرافي عن نفسه بطرق مختلفة. ينمو نظام تعليم Gauteng سنويًا بنسبة 2.5٪ ، أو زيادة صافية قدرها 65000 متعلم سنويًا. يجب أن يضاف إلى ذلك الهجرة الداخلية من المقاطعات والبلدان الأخرى إلى Gauteng. اقرأ | بعد خمس سنوات من إطلاقه ، لا يزال نظام التطبيق المدرسي عبر الإنترنت الخاص بـ Gauteng يعاني من مشكلات.انتقلت الأغلبية السوداء إلى مجتمعات هندية سابقة ، بيضاء وملونة ، ومع ذلك لم يتم تصميم المدارس في هذه المناطق لاستيعاب عدد كبير من المتعلمين. تعد غوتنغ أيضًا مكانًا عالميًا والمجتمعات متعددة اللغات ، ويجب أن تلبي المدارس خيارات لغوية مختلفة. المدارس الفردية المتوسطة التي ولدت عن طريق تخطيط الفصل العنصري في البلدات والضواحي ليست قابلة للحياة على المدى الطويل حيث سينفد عدد كافٍ من المتعلمين لتشكيل مدرسة. ومع ذلك ، يظل 75٪ من المتعلمين الأفارقة في مدارس البلديات والمدارس في المناطق الهندية السابقة والمناطق الملونة بها 50٪ من المتعلمين الأفارقة. التأثير المشترك للتغيير الديموغرافي هو طلب كبير على مساحات التعلم أو الفصول الدراسية في موقف مقيد بالعرض. مطلوب المزيد من المدارس والفصول الدراسية للتعامل مع التراكم التاريخي وتلبية الطلب الجديد في المقاطعة. يتوقع أحد التقديرات أن هناك حاجة إلى أكثر من 100 مدرسة جديدة في المقاطعة لتلبية الطلب الحالي. على هذه الجبهة ، يطارد القسم هدفًا متحركًا. إن الافتقار إلى المدارس والفصول الدراسية هو العقبة النهائية أمام وضع المتعلمين بدلاً من نظام الإنترنت. القدرات الجديدة المطلوبة يتم تنفيذ العديد من التدخلات لزيادة عدد الفصول الدراسية ، ولكن ما لم يتم إضافة سعة جديدة ، سيظل القبول في مدارس Gauteng يمثل تحديًا سنويًا. في غضون ذلك ، تم تحويل الأموال إلى المدارس ، وخاصة في البلدات والضواحي التاريخية لبناء فصول دراسية إضافية. بالإضافة إلى ذلك ، يتم تصنيع الفصول الدراسية المتنقلة ونشرها في المدارس ، للأسف بوتيرة أبطأ مما كان متوقعًا. من المقبول الآن أن الوضع الاقتصادي في البلاد متوتر. وقد أدى ذلك إلى قيام العديد من الآباء بإخراج أطفالهم من المدارس المستقلة / الخاصة إلى المدارس العامة. قدّم الآباء الذين لم يعد بإمكانهم تحمل الرسوم في المدارس المستقلة أو الخاصة ، طلبات الالتحاق بالصفوف ما بين الصفوف إلى العديد من المدارس العامة. لا يزال من الصعب إيجاد أماكن لهؤلاء المتعلمين في المدارس. يعد القبول في المدارس بمثابة توازن دقيق بين اختيار الوالدين ، بناءً على مناطق التغذية ، وتوافر المدارس أو الفصول الدراسية. تصل العديد من المدارس في Gauteng إلى سعتها في اليوم الأول من التنسيب. لتوضيح هذه النقطة ، لنفترض أن المدرسة يمكنها قبول 200 متعلم ، ولكن يتقدم 1000 ولي أمر إلى المدرسة ، وينبغي استيعاب فائض 800 متعلم في مكان آخر. يعتمد وضع الـ 200 أيضًا على ما إذا كان جميع المتعلمين في المدرسة قد تمت ترقيتهم إلى الصف التالي. في ظل هذه الظروف ، لا يمكن استيعاب جميع المتعلمين في هذه المدرسة ، والقسم ملزم بإيجاد بديل وتقديمه. يقبل بعض الآباء البديل ، بينما يرفض البعض هذه الخيارات لأسباب متنوعة. يمكن للوالد الاعتراض أو تقديم استئناف ، ولا تنجح هذه الإجراءات إلا إذا لم تتبع المدرسة أو المسؤولون تعليمات القبول. ومع ذلك ، كان من الممكن أن يفي القسم بالتزامه بتقديم التنسيب ، ولكن إذا تم رفض ذلك ، فإنه يتعين على الوالدين الآن إيجاد مدرسة مناسبة. لقد لاحظنا أيضًا بعض الممارسات السلبية حيث يشتري الآباء أو يحصلون على عناوين قريبة من المدرسة المختارة أثناء عدم إقامتهم في منطقة التغذية. وبالتالي ، فإن القبول في المدارس العامة ، خاصة بالنسبة للصفين الأول والثامن المطلوبين بشدة ، هو دالة للعديد من العوامل. يمكن للأغلبية الصامتة أن تشهد على فعالية النظام عبر الإنترنت في معالجة الطلبات ووضع المتعلمين في المدارس. لا يهدف هذا إلى استبعاد المخاوف المشروعة للآباء الذين يسعون إلى الالتحاق بالمدارس ولكن لتوفير مزيد من المعلومات حول القيود الحقيقية الملزمة التي تؤثر على القبول في المدارس. كما أنه ليس عذراً للقسم لعدم القيام بأي شيء. في الواقع ، يستكشف القسم طرقًا مختلفة لتسريع بناء مدارس جديدة وإضافة المزيد من مساحات التعلم. لسوء الحظ ، ميزانية البنية التحتية غير كافية بسبب القيود الاقتصادية ، لكننا سنعمل جاهدين. - ماتومي شيلوان هو MEC للتعليم في Gauteng. * هل تريد الرد على كاتب العمود؟ أرسل رسالتك أو مقالتك إلى comments@news24.com مع ذكر اسمك

"،" المحتوى ":" يعتبر قطاع تجهيز الأغذية في نيبال صناعة متطورة ، وهناك سوق ضخم للواردات الزراعية والغذائية ، حيث ينتج الإنتاج الزراعي فائضًا محدودًا. نظرًا لأن 50 ٪ من واردات نيبال تأتي من الهند ، فإن استهلاك الغذاء في نيبال يتأثر بشكل كبير بممارسات تصنيع الأغذية والتجزئة في الهند التي تحركها حاليًا المعالجة عالية القيمة للمنتجات الزراعية المختلفة ، وزيادة التحضر ، وزيادة الدخل المتاح ، والطلب للحصول على طعام مناسب. مع تطور الاقتصاد النيبالي ، من المرجح أن تتطور خياراتها الغذائية بنفس الطريقة بينما سيصبح الطلب على الرعاية الصحية الوقائية هو المعيار المفضل على عكس الرعاية الصحية العلاجية. ما يعنيه هذا هو أن صناعة الأغذية وقطاع التجزئة يقفان في نقطة التقاء أهدافنا الغذائية. من وضع العلامات على الابتكارات إلى توصيل القيم الغذائية ، هناك دور كبير للقطاع الخاص يلعبه حيث تصبح القدرة على تحمل التكاليف وإمكانية الوصول من العوامل الحاسمة لاختيار الغذاء والوصول إليه ، مما يدفع الأنماط الغذائية والحالة التغذوية والنتائج الصحية والبيئية العامة. في حين أن الزراعة تشكل أكثر من 25 ٪ من الاقتصاد النيبالي ، فإن ما يقرب من 24 ٪ من المحاصيل الزراعية تتكون من إنتاج الأرز ، وبالتالي فإن نيبال بلد يأكل الأرز ، مع نظام غذائي غني بالكربوهيدرات. ثانيًا ، يؤدي نقص الوعي بشأن الغذاء المتوازن وأهمية البروتين إلى انخفاض استهلاك البروتين في نيبال. وهذه "مفارقة البروتين" الكامنة ، أي الأهمية العالية مقابل الفهم المنخفض ، يمكن أن تكون حيث يمكن للمصنعين وتجار التجزئة أن يتقدموا في جعل نيبال تستهلك البروتين الكافي. جنبًا إلى جنب مع التدابير الداعمة لتحسين معلومات المغذيات (BOP) لحزمة الجزء الخلفي من إدارة تكنولوجيا الأغذية ومراقبة الجودة (BOP) إلى الملصقات التي تتوافق مع معايير الدستور الغذائي ، والكود المقبول دوليًا في مجال الأعمال الغذائية ، تحتاج الصناعة إلى الابتكار أو الدعم الاستباقي وتبني طواعية وسائل إيصال التغذية للمساعدة في التأثير على الخيارات الغذائية. على سبيل المثال ، تم إطلاق ملصق منتجات فول الصويا الطوعي في نيبال في عام 2022 كعلامة تغذية فريدة لمنتجات البروتين الحيواني عالية الجودة. إصدار البيانات الصحفية والإيجازات والتعليقات نشر التقارير والدراسات والمنشورات تقديم تقارير مكتوبة أو شفهية للجان والاستفسارات البرلمانية العمل مع وسائل الإعلام عقد الاجتماعات والفعاليات العامة عقد المؤتمرات وورش العمل إنشاء المواد التعليمية والمساهمة فيها نشر الاتصالات الغذائية من خلال مجموعة من وسائل أو أدوات مختلفة مثل الراديو والتلفزيون والفيديو والأفلام والإنترنت ووسائل التواصل الاجتماعي والصحف والنشرات الإخبارية والنشرات وحملات الملصقات والفنون. أيضًا ، بما في ذلك الأدوات المرئية مثل الملصقات والشعارات والقمصان واللافتات ، يمكن لصناعة الدواجن أن تتبنى ملصق منتج فول الصويا الفريد وأن تستغل الفرص للتحدث عن كيف تتكون علف الحيوانات من بروتين عالي الجودة كما نعلم جميعًا الحصول على التغذية ليس سوى جزء من قصة التغذية الشاملة. لضمان تحسين النتائج الغذائية ، فإن توعية المستهلك حول الآثار الصحية السلبية لممارسات التغذية غير المتوازنة أمر بالغ الأهمية. أدت نسبة منخفضة من الأطعمة الغنية بالبروتين مثل فول الصويا والحليب واللحوم والبيض والبقوليات في النظام الغذائي اليومي إلى سوء تغذية لملايين النيباليين بما في ذلك مشكلة التقزم لدى ما يقرب من 40٪ من الأطفال دون سن الخامسة. لذلك ، تلعب الصناعة دورًا رئيسيًا في توصيل توصيات التغذية للمستهلك. يمكن أن يساعد تحسين الوعي بعدة طرق ، بما في ذلك - معالجة الجيوب الإقليمية التي تعاني من نقص شديد في المغذيات الدقيقة ، وتمكين المستهلك من تجنب مشكلات الجودة والسلامة المحددة مع الأطعمة ، وتمكين اتخاذ قرارات أفضل في الخيارات الغذائية للطاقة اليومية ، والبروتين ، والدهون ، والقيادة طلب السوق على المنتجات الجديدة ، مما يتيح خيارات أوسع ، ومنتجات ذات جودة أفضل ، وإنشاء قطاعات غذائية جديدة. يحتاج مصنعو المواد الغذائية وتجار التجزئة في نيبال أيضًا إلى تحقيق التوازن بين طلب المستهلكين على أغذية ميسورة التكلفة ومريحة وبين الحاجة إلى تعزيز الخيارات الغذائية الصحية. وهذا يتطلب إجراء موازنة دقيق ، حيث قد لا يكون العديد من المستهلكين مستعدين أو غير قادرين على دفع علاوة لخيارات صحية ، خاصة في بلد يمثل فيه انعدام الأمن الغذائي تحديًا كبيرًا. ومع ذلك ، في الوقت نفسه ، هناك اعتراف متزايد بأن الافتقار إلى الحصول على البروتين الكافي هو عامل رئيسي يسهم في سوء التغذية والنتائج الصحية السيئة. في نهاية المطاف ، سيعتمد نجاح صناعة الأغذية في نيبال على قدرتها على التكيف مع احتياجات المستهلكين وتفضيلاتهم المتغيرة مع تعزيز نتائج صحية أفضل للجميع. من خلال العمل معًا لزيادة الوعي بأهمية البروتين وتطوير منتجات جديدة واستراتيجيات تسويق تلبي احتياجات المستهلكين ، يمكن لمصنعي المواد الغذائية وتجار التجزئة المساعدة في بناء نظام غذائي أكثر استدامة ومرونة لمستقبل نيبال. بعبارة أخرى ، تتمثل الحدود التالية لمصنعي الأغذية النيباليين وتجار التجزئة والمستوردين في ضمان توافر الأطعمة الصحية والمغذية ، وإحداث ثورة في طريقة تقديم الطعام والمساعدة في رحلة الشراء للمستهلكين. بصفتي رئيس جمعية صناعات الأعلاف النيبالية وداعمًا قويًا لمبادرة الحق في البروتين ، أحث الصناعة على توحيد الجهود والعمل معًا لتحقيق هذا الهدف المشترك المتمثل في الوعي التغذوي من أجل الأمن الغذائي ، بدءًا من المغذيات الكبيرة الأكثر أهمية - "البروتين" ". من تعزيز التواصل بالبروتين على المنتجات إلى الجهود المكرسة في #ProteinDay لدعم مبادرات التوعية العامة ، تلعب صناعة الأغذية دورًا استباقيًا أكبر في تمكين بلدنا من مكافحة فقر التغذية المقنع وجعله آمنًا من حيث التغذية. رابين بوري هو رئيس جمعية الصناعات العلفية النيبالية وداعم لمبادرة "الحق في البروتين".
